# SharpEarth
osgEarth in C#

SharpEarth is a thin, C++/CLI layer on top of [OpenSceneGraph](https://github.com/openscenegraph/osg) and [osgEarth](https://github.com/gwaldron/osgearth).  

### Building the dependencies
I am considering providing a download to all the prebuilt libraries, but for now the OSG and OSGEarth dependencies need to be built manually following the steps below.  Also, the OSG and OSGEarth websites have great documentation on how to build.

* Download [OpenSceneGraph 3-2.2](http://trac.openscenegraph.org/downloads/developer_releases/OpenSceneGraph-3.2.2.zip) and extract to C:\SharpEarth
* Download [3rdParty Dependencies](http://download.osgvisual.org/3rdParty_VS2013_v120_x86_x64_V9_full.7z) and extract to C:\SharpEarth
* Download [OsgEarth-2.7](https://github.com/gwaldron/osgearth/zipball/osgearth-2.7) and extract to C:\SharpEarth
